Web Deveoploment class Coursework

Staying physically active and maintaining sufficient exercise is a challenge in the current COVID situation.


Design and implement a web-based activity planner application to help students keep track of their weekly exercise goals as well as their achievements.  


The application allows the user to define their own training schedule for each week. 

Users of the application can also record their actual achievements. 


These training goals and achievements are private, i.e. they are only visible to this logged in user.
